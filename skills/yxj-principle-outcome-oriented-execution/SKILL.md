# Outcome-Oriented Execution

## File boundary

The workflow root is the directory this skill runs in (`<execution-root>`). Every durable file this skill
generates goes under:

```text
<execution-root>/.work-docs/tasks/<task-id>/
├── contract.md   what done means, allowed changes, verification layers
├── state.md      stage, status, evidence pointers, blockers
├── outputs/      final reports, designs, plans, manuals
├── evidence/     command output, measurements, failure evidence
├── audit/        decisions, checkpoints, work-in-progress records
└── tmp/          fixtures and disposable material
```

Reuse the task id already in progress when the scope matches (read `.work-docs/index.md` first), otherwise
allocate one: `{YYYYMMDD}-{NN}-{slug}`, where `NN` is a two-digit per-day counter that restarts at `01`
and never reuses a retired number, then append the new task to `.work-docs/index.md`. Never place workflow
output in a project docs directory, in another skill's directory, in a tool-specific hidden directory, or
outside the repository.

Files that are themselves the task target -- project code, project docs, existing config -- may be modified
in place. Record those paths in the contract and in `evidence/` before changing them, and do not copy them
into `.work-docs`. Before running any third-party skill that writes files, take a before/after inventory; a
write outside `.work-docs` that the contract did not authorize is a boundary violation: stop and report it.

Optimize for the intended, verifiable end state rather than preserving smooth intermediate states.

**Why:** Keeping every intermediate step fully stable often creates temporary compatibility code that becomes long-lived debt. Converge on the target architecture and prove correctness at explicit verification boundaries.

**Core rule:**
- Prioritize end-state integrity over transitional stability
- Intermediate breakage is acceptable when it is planned, scoped, and reversible

**Guardrails:**
- Use this for planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries
- Declare where temporary breakage is acceptable
- Keep high-signal checks for actively touched areas while migrating
- Require full static and runtime verification at plan completion
