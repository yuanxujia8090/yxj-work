# Guard the Context Window

## File boundary

The workflow root is the directory this skill runs in (`<execution-root>`). Every durable file this skill
generates goes under:

```text
<execution-root>/.work-docs/tasks/<task-id>/
├── contract.md   what done means, allowed changes, verification layers
├── state.md      stage, status, evidence pointers, blockers
├── outputs/      final reports, designs, plans, manuals
├── evidence/     command output, measurements, failure evidence
├── audit/        decisions, checkpoints, work-in-progress records
└── tmp/          fixtures and disposable material
```

Reuse the task id already in progress when the scope matches (read `.work-docs/index.md` first), otherwise
create one. Never place workflow output in a project docs directory, in another skill's directory, in a
tool-specific hidden directory, or outside the repository. The full rule lives in `docs/file-boundary.md`
of the yxj-work source repository.

Files that are themselves the task target -- project code, project docs, existing config -- may be modified
in place. Record those paths in the contract and in `evidence/` before changing them, and do not copy them
into `.work-docs`. Before running any third-party skill that writes files, take a before/after inventory; a
write outside `.work-docs` that the contract did not authorize is a boundary violation: stop and report it.


The context window is finite and non-renewable within a session. Every token should be worth its cost.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Isolate large payloads.** Route verbose outputs, screenshots, and large documents to subagents. The main context gets summaries, not raw data.
- **Keep frequently used content inline.** Templates and references used on every invocation belong in the skill file, not in separate files that cost a read each time.
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
